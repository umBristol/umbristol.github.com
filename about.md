The Bristol Umbraco User Group - [umbristol.co.uk](http://umbristol.co.uk)

The aim of the user-group is to meet on a monthly basis, with a 2-monthly rotation: one month being an informal social gathering at a pub; the following month an office-based session/talk meet-up hosted by a local Umbraco partner/business.

The user-group was established in [January 2010](/archive/). A typical social meet-up is attended by 10+ people, where as the session/talks meet-ups attract larger attendees (20+ people).
